TIMING-20#1 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch u_fout0/location_reg[0] cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin u_fout0/location_reg[0]/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#2 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch u_fout0/location_reg[1] cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin u_fout0/location_reg[1]/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

LATCH-1#1 Advisory
Existing latches in the design  
There are 2 latches found in the design. Inferred latches are often the result of HDL coding mistakes, such as incomplete if or case statements.
Related violations: <none>
